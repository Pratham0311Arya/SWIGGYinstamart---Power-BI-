# SWIGGYinstamart Sales Report
## Introduction
In my latest project, I gathered data from several Swiggy Instamart outlets, conducted thorough analysis, and created an interactive dashboard using Power BI. The project involved tasks such as data cleaning, visualization, and dashboard creation. The project aims to provide valuable information for improving marketing strategies, product offerings, and operational efficiency.

Here are the key analyses performed in my project:

- Identified the Tier city that generates the highest sales.
- Calculated the average, total, and average order value based on location type.
- Determined which type of stores bring in the most business.
- Identified the best-selling product.
- Analyzed the periods (years) during which store sales were the highest.
- Determined the most sold product category.
- Conducted analysis based on food nutrition facts (e.g., fat content, healthiness).

And more.
